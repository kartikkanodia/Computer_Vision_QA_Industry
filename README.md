# Computer_Vision_QA_Industry
Application of Computer Vision in Qualiy Assurance:
This project uses binary classification to assist quality assurance process in the industry. 
Using this project we can compare a high resolution photo of a newly manufactured object with a reference image and fin out if there have been any visual flaws during the manufacturing process.  

The Files should be run in the following order:

#Training the Binary Classifier and MRCNN Model:
1) binary_classifier_schraube
2) MRCNN_modeltraining
3) mrcnn_xmltococo

#Demonstration:
1) func_image_alignment
2) MRCNN_inferencing
3) Binary_Classification_Implementation
4) Result_Dashboard
